      There's a sidebar menu you can open with a button in the top-left corner
      of your screen. <strong>Make sure not to click "Play Cards".</strong>
    </li>

      If your audio's wonky, open the sound menu in the bottom-left, where you
      can adjust your voice volume. Make sure the "how do I sound" button isn't
      highlighted.

      In the "Audio" menu (top-left sidebar), you can also turn on echo
      cancellation and noise suppression.

      Let everyone know who you are by making sure your name is set and that
      you've uploaded a picture for yourself! You can edit your information from
      the sidebar.
