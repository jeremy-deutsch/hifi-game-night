  <h1>Welcome! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
  <h3>Here are some tips to get you started.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      First, welcome to High Fidelity! Here, you can only hear people who are
      close to you. To move around, drag the screen or use the arrow keys (or
      WASD), and scroll to zoom in or out. Come say hi!
    </li>
    <li>
      There's a sidebar menu you can open with a button in the top-left corner
      of your screen. <strong>Make sure not to click the "Play Cards" option in
        that menu.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Let everyone know who you are! You can set your name and upload a picture
      from the "Profile" menu in the sidebar.
    </li>
    <li>
      There are three places on the map where you'll see a "Play" button next to
      a <img
        src="/write.png"
        alt="writing"
        style="display:inline;"
        height="16" /> icon. That's where you play a game! Clicking the <img
        src="/write.png"
        alt="writing"
        style="display:inline;"
        height="16" /> lets you see what games are available to play, and lets you
      edit what URL the "Play" button points to. Once you have a game set up, use
      the <img
        src="/write.png"
        alt="writing"
        style="display:inline;"
        height="16" /> page to point the "Play" button to your game's room!
    </li>
    <li>
      If your audio's wonky, open the sound menu in the bottom-left, where you
      can adjust your voice volume. Make sure the "HOW DO I SOUND" button is
      toggled off.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the "Audio" menu in the sidebar, you can also turn on echo cancellation
      and noise suppression. Spare your friends' ears.
    </li>
  </ul>
